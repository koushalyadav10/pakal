        <h2>What is a Coastal Flood?</h2>
        <p>A coastal flood is the inundation of land areas along the coast by seawater. This type of flooding is often caused by storm surges during severe weather events such as hurricanes or nor'easters.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Stay informed: Monitor weather forecasts and warnings from local authorities.</li>
            <li>Know your evacuation routes and have a plan in place.</li>
            <li>Prepare an emergency kit with essentials like water, food, medications, and important documents.</li>
            <li>Protect your property: Elevate utilities, install flood barriers, and secure outdoor items.</li>
            <li>During a coastal flood watch or warning, follow instructions from emergency officials and evacuate if necessary.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>What to Do During a Coastal Flood</h2>
